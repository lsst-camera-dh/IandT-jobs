* Outline
- Power-on tests: \code{rtm\_aliveness\_power\_on}
- Exposure tests: \code{rtm\_aliveness\_exposure}

* Power-on tests: rtm\_aliveness\_power\_on
This harnessed job was derived from [[https://github.com/lsst-camera-dh/harnessed-jobs/tree/master/T08/rebalive_power/v0][\code{harnessed-jobs/T08/rebalive\_power}]],
which was implemented at BNL.  This job performs the following steps:
- Define the current limits for the channels (DigI, AnaI, ClkHI, ClkLI, ODI)
  to be checked.
- Maps each REB to the corresponding power-line.
- Loop over the REBs:
  - Power on each channel in order, checking the currents for ClkHI, ClkLI, ODI.
  - If a current is out-of-range, power down that channel and abort.
  - Issue a warning if the current measured by the REB power-supply subsystem
    differs from the ts8 subsystem by more than 10%.
- Load the sensor specific configurations.
- Run the [[https://github.com/lsst-camera-ccs/org-lsst-ccs-subsystem-ts8/blob/master/main/src/main/java/org/lsst/ccs/subsystem/ts8/TS8Subsystem.java#L696][\code{powerOn}]] command from the [[https://github.com/lsst-camera-ccs/org-lsst-ccs-subsystem-ts8][\code{org.lsst.ccs.subsystem.ts8}]]
  package for each REB.  This performs the "safe power on" sequence and
  performs a series of tests, and finishes by loading the ASPICs and DACs.

* Exposure tests: \code{rtm\_aliveness\_exposure}
This job is based on [[https://github.com/lsst-camera-dh/harnessed-jobs/tree/master/T08/rebalive_exposure/v0][\code{harnessed-jobs/T08/rebalive\_exposure}]]:
- Verify that the three expected REB devices are available.
- Load the sequencer file specified in the \code{acq.cfg} file.
- Take a series of test exposures:
  - zero second (100ms) BIAS frame
  - 1 second FLAT frame
  - 4 second FE55 frame
  These tests exercise different branches of the CCS code, bias vs exposure,
  XED arm deployment, monochromater shutter.
- For the initial aliveness testing, these are room temperature
  exposures, so there will be substantial dark current.  A simple
  analysis comparing the signal imaging section pixels to the signal
  in the overscan regions is used to identify "bad" channels.

Simulated TS8 traveler:
* Prerequisites:
  * Populated raft with hardware id "ScienceRaft-xx" registered in
    the eT tables.

* Acquisition jobs: Fe55, dark, flat_pair, ppump, sflat, qe, spot
  * Jobs will query eT tables for sensor ids for the raft
  * Each job will simulate acquisition by CCS by copying queried single
    sensor datasets from DC into the staging area.
  * JH code will use the directory path policy string and fileref mechanism
    to put files in the right locations and persist those locations in the
    eT tables.

* Analysis jobs: Fe55 (gain, psf), bright defects, dark defects, dark current,
                 linearity, full well, traps, cte, prnu, QE, crosstalk
  * standard dependency glob mechanism will be used to find datasets from
    acq jobs.
